.SH NAME
pmount \- add a filesystem entry to /etc/fstab using UUID and mount it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pmount
.RI "[" OPTIONS "]"
.I device_path
.I mount_point_directory
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmount
is a shell script that automates the process of making a filesystem mount persistent across reboots. It is typically used by a system administrator after creating and formatting a new block device, such as an LVM Logical Volume or a partition, and wants to ensure it's mounted automatically on boot.
.P
The script performs the following steps:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Validates that it is run with root privileges.
.IP \(bu 2
Handles
.B \-\-version
,
.B \-\-help
, and
.B \-h
options if provided as the sole argument.
.IP \(bu 2
Validates that exactly two arguments, representing the block device path and the mount point directory, are provided for the main functionality.
.IP \(bu 2
Validates that the specified block device path exists and is a block device.
.IP \(bu 2
Validates that the specified mount point directory exists and is a directory.
.IP \(bu 2
Uses the
.B blkid (8)
command to reliably find the filesystem UUID and type of the block device. Exits if no filesystem UUID is found (i.e., the device is not formatted).
.IP \(bu 2
Checks if an entry for the found UUID
.IR ( UUID=... )
or the specified mount point already exists in
.IR /etc/fstab .
If an entry is found, the script exits with an error to prevent duplicates or unintended modifications.
.IP \(bu 2
If no existing entry is found, it adds a new entry to
.IR /etc/fstab
using the found UUID, the specified mount point, the determined filesystem type (or 'auto' as a fallback), and default mount options (
.B defaults 0 0
).
.IP \(bu 2
Attempts to mount all filesystems listed in
.IR /etc/fstab
using
.B mount \-a (8)
to verify the syntax of the new entry and the availability of the device.
.IP \(bu 2
Provides informative messages throughout the process and a success message if all steps complete without error.
.RE
.P
This script requires root privileges to modify
.IR /etc/fstab
and execute the
.B mount
command.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the script version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help , \-h
Show a brief help message including usage and options, and exit.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I device_path
The absolute path to the block device containing the filesystem to be permanently mounted (e.g., /dev/sda1, /dev/mapper/myvg-mydata, /dev/disk/by-uuid/... ).
.TP
.I mount_point_directory
The absolute path to the existing directory where the filesystem should be mounted (e.g., /mnt/data, /srv/appdata). This directory must exist and be a directory before running the script.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B sudo pmount /dev/myvg/mydata /mnt/appdata
Adds an /etc/fstab entry for the Logical Volume /dev/myvg/mydata using its UUID, setting the mount point to /mnt/appdata with default options, and attempts to mount it.
.TP
.B sudo pmount /dev/sdb1 /var/lib/mysql
Adds an /etc/fstab entry for the partition /dev/sdb1 using its UUID, setting the mount point to /var/lib/mysql with default options, and attempts to mount it.
.TP
.B pmount \-\-version
Display the script version.
.TP
.B pmount \-\-help
Display the help message.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success. The /etc/fstab entry was added and the mount attempt (mount -a) was successful.
.TP
.B 1
Failure. An error occurred due to:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Incorrect number of arguments or invalid argument used.
.IP \(bu 2
Insufficient privileges (not run as root).
.IP \(bu 2
Invalid device path or mount point (doesn't exist, wrong type).
.IP \(bu 2
Inability to find a filesystem UUID for the device.
.IP \(bu 2
An entry for the UUID or mount point already exists in
.IR /etc/fstab .
.IP \(bu 2
A failure during the attempt to write the entry to
.IR /etc/fstab .
.IP \(bu 2
A failure during the
.B mount \-a
attempt (e.g., syntax error in fstab, device temporarily unavailable, filesystem issues).
.RE
.P
Error messages are printed to standard error.
.SH BUGS
.P
The script exits if an entry for the UUID or mount point already exists. It does not attempt to update or modify existing entries. Manual editing of
.IR /etc/fstab
is required in such cases.
.P
Error messages from the final
.B mount \-a
command might be generic; check system logs for details if it fails.
